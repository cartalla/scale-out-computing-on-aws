# Scale-Out Computing on AWS

## :wrench: How to install Scale-Out Computing on AWS
### 1) 1-Click installer

Visit [https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/scale-out-computing-on-aws](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/scale-out-computing-on-aws)

:rotating_light: 1-Click installer is only great for PoC or demos. For production workload, it's recommended to go with option 2 instead.

### 2) Build and install Scale-Out Computing on AWS on your own AWS account

+ 1\) Clone this git repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/scale-out-computing-on-aws
```
+ 2\) Run the following command to create your build (support Python2 and Python3):
```bash
python source/manual_build.py
```
+ 3\) Output will be created under `source/dist/<build_id>`

+ 4\) Upload `source/dist/<build_id>` folder to your own S3 bucket

+ 5\) Launch CloudFormation and use `scale-out-computing-on-aws.template` as base template
